## Respect, Credit and Recognition

Huge thanks to everyone for sharing and contributing in this competition!

This collection belongs to all of us—it’s built from your efforts too. We’re now at 400, enjoy!

I have included my own solutions and refinements on existing problems but the vast majority of the solutions come from aggregating together work from many others:

- @cristianocalcagno → gcgc-solutions-for-all-400-tasks

- @jazivxt → oh-barnacles

- @markvoi → google-golf-code-98-solved-problems

- @cheeseexports → big-zippa

Also, for all the other tasks solved, credit goes to the many contributors—even if I didn’t reference code from them directly: @adilshamim8 @adyanthm @boristown @bibanh @cheeseexports @daosyduyminh @dedquoc @fedimser @henrychibueze @jacekwl @jaejohn @jazivxt @jeroencottaar @katsuyanomura @kosirowada @krishnayadav456wrsty @kuntalmaity @limalkasadith @mcwema @mmoffitt @mpwolke @muhammaddanyalmalik @muhammadqasimshabbir @nina2025 @ottitsch @quannguyn12 @raviannaswamy @seshura @seshurajup @shevtsovapolina @taylorsamarel @zshashz
